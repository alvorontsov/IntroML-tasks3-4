Preparation

You have to make tasks 1-2

Tasks

3. A continuation of toy tasks with MNIST. Last and simple. 
I implemented for you working notebook, work_book2_1.ipynb . It's almost same with 2nd task but now net is convolutional!

To Do
- Undersand how it works.
- Get the best accuracy you can. You are free to add new layers. I expect more that 99,2% accuray on test set. If you have less don't hesitate to send me an email.
- Look and answer which images in test set are classified wrong? why?
- How many times less parameters in this model in comparison with the model in task 2?
Prohibitedto use: 
nothing

Report:
 python file with your implementation. I will run it.
 answer on my questions
 Accuracy(%), describe what and why you have changed, the code. What changes were most important. Put it in the shared table https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17J278Kfp3IgGPzWg2CQ3gkfHcFHfl7cxe4x0vI1YsMg/edit#gid=0

Deadline: 1 week

4. Faces. Real life example. Almost reallife. I decided to help you and I give you a set of images collected for my bachelor thesis in past. There are almost same net work_book2_2.ipynb .
You really need a gpu now. (if you can't find a machine with gpu send me an email)

To Do
- Get the best accuracy you can. You are free to add new layers. I expect more that 50% accuray on test set. If you have less don't hesitate to send me an email.
